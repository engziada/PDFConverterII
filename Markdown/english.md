## Slide: 114
### Lesson: Use modals of deduction to discuss environmental problems
### Content:
Students learn to use modals to express degrees of certainty about environmental issues.
### Example:
- The frequent storms must be a result of climate change.
- The declining fish populations could be due to overfishing.
- The improved air quality might be linked to reduced traffic during lockdowns.

### Lesson: Learn how to interpret and describe data related to environmental trends
### Content:
Students practice analyzing and explaining graphs, charts, and statistics related to environmental issues.
### Example:
This graph shows global temperature anomalies over the past century. We can see a clear upward trend, with the rate of increase accelerating in recent decades. The red bars indicate years with temperatures above the long-term average, which have become increasingly common since the 1980s.

### Lesson: Theoretical Questions
### Question:
Explain the difference between using "must," "could," and "might" when making deductions about environmental problems.
### Answer:
"Must" expresses a high degree of certainty, while "could" and "might" express a lower degree of certainty.
### Question:
How does the third conditional help in discussing past environmental decisions and their impacts?
### Answer:
It allows us to explore hypothetical alternative outcomes of past events.
### Question:
What are some key elements of persuasive language, and how can they be applied to advocate for sustainable practices?

### Lesson: Practical Questions
### Question:
Write three sentences using modals of deduction to discuss possible causes of bee population decline.
### Answer:
(Example Answer) The use of pesticides must be a major factor. The loss of habitat could also be a cause. Climate change might be affecting their ability to find food.
### Question:
Compose a paragraph using the third conditional to discuss how a major environmental disaster could have been prevented.
### Answer:
(Example Answer) If the company had maintained its equipment properly, the oil spill could have been prevented. If the government had enforced stricter regulations, the company would have been forced to take more precautions.

## Slide: 124
### Lesson: Practical Questions
### Question:
You are an environmental consultant. Write a short proposal (150-200 words) for implementing a plastic reduction program in your local community.
### Answer:
(Example Answer)
Proposal: Plastic Reduction Program

This proposal outlines a program to reduce plastic waste in our community. The program would focus on three main areas: education, incentives, and infrastructure. We would launch a public awareness campaign to educate residents about the environmental impact of plastic. We would also work with local businesses to offer incentives for customers who use reusable bags and containers. Finally, we would install more water fountains and bottle-refilling stations throughout the community.
### Question:
Analyze the following graph showing global CO2 emissions over the past 50 years. Describe the trends you observe and suggest possible reasons for these trends.
### Answer:
(Example Answer) The graph shows a steady increase in global CO2 emissions over the past 50 years. This trend is likely due to a combination of factors, including population growth, industrialization, and our reliance on fossil fuels.
